# Object-Oriented Coffee Machine Program

This is a coffee machine program implemented in Python using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The program simulates a coffee machine that allows users to select different types of coffee, make payment, and receive their desired coffee if the required resources are available and the payment is sufficient.

## Features

- **Menu**: The coffee machine offers a menu with different types of coffee, including espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Each coffee has its own set of ingredients and cost associated with it.

- **Resource Management**: The program uses classes and objects to manage available resources such as water, milk, and coffee. Each resource is represented by a separate class, and the coffee machine object tracks the quantities of each resource. It checks if there are sufficient resources to make the selected coffee and deducts the required ingredients from the available resources upon successful preparation.

- **Payment System**: Users can make payment by entering the number of coins for each denomination (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). The program calculates the total amount and checks if the payment is sufficient for the selected coffee. It also handles the calculation of change, if necessary.

- **Reporting**: The coffee machine object provides a report functionality that displays the current status of available resources (water, milk, coffee) and the total profit earned. This information is easily accessible through methods of the coffee machine object.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


4. Follow the prompts on the console to interact with the coffee machine. You can select the type of coffee, insert coins for payment, and view reports.

5. To turn off the coffee machine, enter "off" when prompted for a choice.
